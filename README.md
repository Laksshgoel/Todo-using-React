Full-Stack To-Do List App (React + Node.js + MongoDB)
Project Overview
This project is a full-stack To-Do List application built using React.js for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. The app allows users to add, update, and delete tasks, storing them in a persistent database. The backend serves as an API that connects with the React frontend to manage task-related operations.

Tech Stack
Frontend (React.js)
React.js: For building the user interface.
CSS: For styling the UI and making it responsive.
Axios (optional): To handle API requests to the backend.
Backend (Node.js + Express.js)
Node.js: The runtime environment for the server.
Express.js: A framework for building RESTful APIs.
CORS: Middleware to allow communication between frontend and backend.
MongoDB + Mongoose: A NoSQL database for storing tasks
Key Features
âœ… Task Management: Users can add, update, and delete tasks.
âœ… Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved in MongoDB, ensuring data persistence.
âœ… REST API: The backend provides structured API endpoints for task management.
âœ… Responsive UI: The frontend is styled with CSS for a clean user experience.
âœ… Full-Stack Integration: React frontend communicates seamlessly with the Node.js backend.

Future Enhancements
ðŸš€ User Authentication (Login & Register).
ðŸš€ Task Categorization (Work, Personal, etc.).
ðŸš€ Due Dates & Reminders for tasks.
ðŸš€ Deploy on Cloud (e.g., Heroku, Vercel, MongoDB Atlas).

Conclusion
This project demonstrates full-stack development with React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, covering both frontend and backend integration. It is a scalable and extendable application that can be improved with more features.
